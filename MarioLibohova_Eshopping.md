## Project Abstract
I was looking back at the slides, UML-ObjectDiagrams_ClassDiagrams.pdf and I found a class example we talked about in class and thought about expanding on it to meet project requirements rather than looking for a source code I had no idea about and honestly did not feel like learning code that was given when I have ideas of my own. Furthermore if you click on the link provided below this paragraph the idea of this project is mainly there is a customer and the customer must have a membership to access items and the items have categories such as top selling items, items on sale, and regular items. Once you find the item you are looking for it goes into the databse to find websites that have that item and then you use the cart to buy with 3 different payment methods and amount of the item you want to buy.

## Project Relevance
The proposal is linked with educational goals of this class and I believe the category it fits in is Object-Oreinted-Design, Debugging,Access to Database, and Code profiling and optimization. It uses Object Oreinted Principles such as Polymorphism, Inheritance and Abstraction. There will be debugging, access to database in terms of different websites through possibly API and attempt on Code profiling and optimization. Also Test Driven Development.
