## Project Abstract
I was looking back at the slides, UML-ObjectDiagrams_ClassDiagrams.pdf and I found a class example we talked about in class and thought about expanding on it to meet project requirements rather than looking for a source code I had no idea about and honestly did not feel like learning code that was given when I have ideas of my own. Furthermore if you click on the link provided below this paragraph the idea of this project is mainly there is a customer and the customer must have a membership to access items and the items have categories such as top selling items, items on sale, and regular items. Once you find the item you are looking for it goes into the databse to find websites that have that item and then you use the cart to buy with 3 different payment methods and amount of the item you want to buy.

## Project Relevance
The proposal is linked with educational goals of this class and I believe the categories it fits in is Object-Oreinted-Design, Debugging,Access to Database, and Code profiling and optimization. It uses Object Oreinted Principles such as Polymorphism, Inheritance and Abstraction. There will be debugging, access to database in terms of different websites through possibly API and attempt on Code profiling and optimization. Also Test Driven Development.

## Conceptual Design
Well I'd like to build this with a team who has some interest of this idea. I don't think its anything too complicated but not easy either. The idea is very direct in my opinion and can be done in Java or Python. As long as we divide the work and contribute little by little it will be a perfect masterpiece and not spaghetti code. The IDE I'll be using is Intellij and it should be simple to add JUnit tests for testing. Customer>Membership valid > Items from 3 different categories> website> cart> order> payment

## Background

Building & Running: So we will be using Intellij IDEA and add JUnit Testing which is straight foward and should work with no issues. This isn't from a source necessarily so I don't think we are restricted on how to set up classes and do tests.
